# extwork
This is an Extension which works like temporary Notepad for writing some temporary notes, urls, or other information.
Just tap and write something in the text white field then, to save, click save button. It will save it. Then if you want to
get the data stored then, click on open to get the data. The data will be displayed in the text field the way you wrote it.

Thank You
